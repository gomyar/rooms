 - add version tag + version number to setup.py

 - sort out api_rooms.js
   - stop sending username from client
   - infer username from cookie
   - cookie created by auth call on master
     - basic auth just allows the username to be sent in plaintext

 - add check for existing scripts (scripts which are assumed to exist: game_script.py player_script.py)

 - load rooms from map.json + state from db

 - state object sends diff for all changes made

 - DictState ListState InventoryState

 - internal & external state

 - bug: admin console will create a room (and a game) if none exists

 - settings for map url
 - settings for master domain
 - settings for node domain(s) (possibly startup option on node)

 - buggered if this api isn't crying out to be RESTful

 - learn how bower works

 - expose all actor state to admin

 - node need to deactivate if all players have disconnected

 - add master_domain to master and node

 - node polls dbase for actors entering rooms (mongo query-update)

 - might need a queued approach to transferring actors between rooms:
   - game_id.room_id queue per room for actors
   - game_id.room_id queue per room for players
   - nodes listen on whatever room queues they are managing rooms for
   - the queues are queues for entry to the room

 - node saves everything on exit

 - check RPCWaitsExceptions for:
   - player moves room to offline node
   - actor (npc) moves room to offline node

   - master.actor_entered - if room offline, send wait
   - node._send_actor_entered_message - if player and got wait, redirect to master

 - if a room is being torn down:
   - set it to offline in master
   - any node (player) requests for that room are bounced to master
   - any npc requests for that room are ignored
     - npc should restore when/if room comes back up again
   - any player connections for that room are waited

 - get a "connecting/loading" bit going on the js gui

 - actors move slowly on entering a room for some reason

 - since we're doing a bunch of extra http stuff with our rpc interface (http codes for redirection, retry etc) we might wanna expand the return value to include those code, etc, and not just be a dumb json dict assumption of success

 - node pushes load info to master every n seconds

 - add admin client

 - deactivate room if no players enter for period of time

 - container save queue

 - complex state objects (tiered, automatic updated for each)
   - to be used for complex actor fields like inventory, chat, quest log etc.

 - automatic websocket keep alive

 - proxy
   - on player connect, query master for node to connect to, bounce to node
   - on player join, same

 - node
   - player objects are conected to 1 room at a time
     - player may interact with actors in that room
     - PlayerActor is only actor the player directly controls / follows through doors

   - if no nodes registered, players wait on queue for a room to be created

 - saves - save data to mongo on events etc

 - basic demo
   - open to all
   - players join a game, etc, redirect to a node, 

 - remove room when bored

 - master server
   - implement room creation / remove as queue on single gthread
   - queue player connects behind room queue
     - waiting list

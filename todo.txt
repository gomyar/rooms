Do we need a script interface to perform ATs and speed tests?
i.e.:

start_node 10.10.10.1 8080 node1.com 80
start_node 10.10.10.2 8080 node2.com 80

create_game game1

player_joins bob game1

connect bob game1

call walk_to_room foyer

nah

-------------

conn = connect("bob", "game1")

while conn.is_open():
    if conn.room_id == "room1"
        # do room1 stuff 
        enemy = conn.nearest_enemy()

        conn.call("attack", enemy.actor_id)

------------

Player object per Game / Username

user joins a game
player object lookup keyed to username-game_id
player object creation keyed to username-game_id

client requests node info for username-game_id

admin creates game:
create_game script called
game may be open - allowing players to connect later
(game may specify players up front, but that's just a security measure / filter)

player connects to game:
if player doesn't exist
    create_player script called with player selected options
        creates a player (not a player_actor) on master
        should return starting area/room information -> node info

get player node info
redirect to node


    - move controller class into node - done
    - script-created - single-directory (one conf file) game structure - done
    - all data in mongo

    - add items to mansion
    - add notes (evidence)
    - add dungeon game to list of available games

    - api optimization - diff actor updates - really important (when time comes)
